`Shift+BACKSPACE`
Undo the last seek. This works only if the playlist entry was not changed. Hitting it a second time will go back to the original position. See revert-seek command for details.
`Shift+Ctrl+BACKSPACE`
Mark the current position. This will then be used by `Shift+BACKSPACE` as revert position (once you seek back, the marker will be reset). You can use this to seek around in the file and then return to the exact position where you left off.
`p and SPACE`
Pause (pressing again unpauses).
`.`
Step forward. Pressing once will pause, every consecutive press will play one frame and then go into pause mode again.
`,`
Step backward. Pressing once will pause, every consecutive press will play one frame in reverse and then go into pause mode again.
